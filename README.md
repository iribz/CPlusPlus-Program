Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. 

-The main task of this project was to create an application for a grocery store that analyzes the text records they generate throughout the day. The program has four functionalities: first must display the items and the quantity purchased in a day, the second must show the sold quantity of a specific item entered by the user, third must display a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day. 

What did you do particularly well? 

-I think I structured very well the project. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? 

-I could enhance my code by using a switch statement for the menu. I think the code would look neater if I would use one. Also, I could use special syntax for the infographic of the menu instead of using strings filled with characters. 

Which pieces of code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? 

-The most challenging part was reading the file in Python. I could see that the file was open for reading but I could not see its content. It took me a while to fix this problem. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? 

-Integrating two languages to create a project was very challenging and very useful. I never thought two languages could be combined and could not see the importance and reasoning behind doing so. Now I understand the strengths and weaknesses behind the studied programming languages and how these could be used at their full potential. I am sure the skills I have acquired in this course will be an excellent foundation for the courses to come. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 

-I used industry standard best practices such as in-line comments and ap propriate naming conventions to make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
